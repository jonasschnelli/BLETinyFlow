- Add multi-connection option or at least block further device connections if connection is busy
- Implement a CRC32 checksum for the whole file
- Optimize logging (move some logs to debug level). Right now, it decreases performance
- Add a test strategy, add unit tests against fixed data (to test error cases, etc.)
- Maybe remove emojis in log messages (still undecided)
- Add message for transfer abort
- Add custom info message (key/value) (like battery info from ESP server to iOS)
