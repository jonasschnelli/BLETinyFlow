- Add multi-connection option or at least block further device connections if connection is busy
- Implement a CRC32 checksum for the entire file
- Optimize logging (move some logs to debug level). Currently, it decreases performance
- Add a test strategy and unit tests against fixed data (to test error cases, etc.)
- Maybe remove emojis from log messages (still undecided)
- Add message for transfer abort
- Add custom info message (key/value) functionality (like battery info from ESP server to iOS)
- iOS app: allow choosing which device to send to
